# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description

An implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">"Rock, Paper, Scissors"</a>.

To win in this implementation of Rock Paper Scissors, you must be the first one 
to reach five points - one point being awarded for each win.

There will be a counter displaying the current score for the computer player 
and also you, the human player. This will be displayed at the top.

You play the game by clicking on the image corresponding to your choice of 
either rock, paper or scissors. These images will be displayed below the score 
counter.

When a winner is announced this will be displayed at the bottom - below the 
middle section of images.

The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## To Do List:

- Add better styling for the score board for the next iteration.
- Add button styling with hover effects to the choice selection buttons for the next iteration.
- Add a play again button with popup for the next iteration.
- Add smiley icons to each of the respective finalGameMessages for the next iteration.
- Possibly add a header and footer depending on aesthetics.
- Refactor javascript code.
